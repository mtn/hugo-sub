Omega Transmission is a browser-based space shooter that I worked on with a team as a part of [Gamkedo Club](http://gamkedo.club/). It includes a series of increasingly challenging waves with a variety of enemy types. Like other games of the genre, the controls are intuitive and easily picked up, but difficulty ramps up quickly.

As a team member I contributed to code and art:

* Added the fleet enemy type and built upon existing assets to produce its sprite.
* Implemented the basic power-up functionality that made it easy to add new power-ups into the game
* Created several of the power-up sprites
* Implemented basic health and shield status bars
* Integrated sound and music into the existing sound system
