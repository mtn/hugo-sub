Made for Ludum Dare in 36 hours in July 2017 with [Zach Caceres](https://github.com/zcaceres) and [Nero Gao](https://github.com/yuangaonyc). The theme was "running out of power." In a blacked out zombie-infested city with flickering streetlights, players must find batteries to keep their flashlight shining â€“ or else.
