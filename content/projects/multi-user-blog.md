Multi-user blog is a simple  Medium-style blog I made to learn more about the Google App Engine. It uses Share Bootstrap's free [Clean Blog Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/), with a backend written in Python.

## Features:

* Secure sign-in
* Comments on posts
* Liking posts/comments (but not your own)
* Users can edit their own posts
