Hi, I'm Michael. I like to play with technology, so I build a lot of [toy projects](https://github.com/mtn?tab=repositories). Outside of computers, I like math, music, behavioral science, philosophy, and a lot of other things.

During the year, I study math and computer science at [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). Previously, I spent three enriching months at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com).
